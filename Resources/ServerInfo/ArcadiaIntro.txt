Welcome to Arcadia Station! You have just started your shift aboard a space station in the outer solar system. Perform your job duties to the best of your ability and survive to live another day in this space wild west capitalist dystopia.

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.

To reiterate, you are all a crew of people who work together and you should not be harming each other unless you have an extremely good reason (self defense) and even then, call for help over radio, try to run or stun and detain, do not commit murder unless your life depended on it or you were protecting someone else's life.

Instead of intents, we have combat mode. Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
